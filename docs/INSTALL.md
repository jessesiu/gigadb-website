# Installing GigaDB using Docker

A test instance of the GigaDB website can be automatically installed on your 
computer as a multi-container application. This involves using 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com), a computer program which allows separate 
applications together with their software dependencies and configuration files 
to be run from within multiple containers. These containers are all isolated 
from one another yet can communicate with each other through well-defined 
channels. Containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are 
therefore more lightweight than virtual machines which were previously used by 
GigaDB as a development environment.

Containers are created from images which specify their contents. In GigaDB, 
several containers are used for implementing the website application and these 
are specified within the docker-compose.yml file. Most of these are standard 
images downloaded from the public repositories, for example the PostgreSQL 
database system, but others such as web are modified before their use. 

## Requirements

* Docker (18 or more recent) is 
  [installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your machine 
  (Windows or macOS)
* You have a [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/), which is a member of the 
  [Gigascience Forks group](https://gitlab.com/gigascience/forks), so you can 
  access the application's 
  [secret variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html)
* You have generated a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) 
  from your GitLab user settings so your local setup can access the secret 
  variables
* You have obtained a copy of the [gigadb-website](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website) of 
  repository using:
  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website.git
```

## Getting started in 3 steps

**(1)** To setup the web application locally, do the following:
```
$ cd gigadb-website                                 # Your cloned git repository for GigaDB website
$ git checkout develop                              # Currently the only branch for which this work
$ cp ops/configuration/variables/env-sample .env    # Make sure GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN is set to your personal access token and GIGADB_ENV=dev
# Check .env file to see if the correct GROUP_VARIABLES_URL and PROJECT_VARIABLES_URL are used!!!
$ docker-compose run --rm config                    # Generate the configuration using variables in .env, GitLab, then exit
```

>**Note 1**:
> A `.secrets` file will be created automatically and populated using secrets 
variables stored in GitLab.

>**Note 2**:
> If you are not a member of the Gigascience Forks GitLab group, you will have 
to provide your own values for the necessary variables using 
`ops/configuration/variables/secrets-sample` as starting point:

>```
>$ cp ops/configuration/variables/secrets-sample .secrets
>$ vi .secrets
>```

**(2)** To start the web application, run the following command:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm webapp                    # Run composer update, then spin up the web application's services, then exit
```

The **webapp** container will run composer update using the `composer.json` 
generated in the previous step, and will launch three containers named **web**, 
**application** and **database**, then it will exit. It's ok to run the command 
repeatedly.

**(3)** Upon success, three services will be started in detached mode.

You can then navigate to the website at:
* [http://gigadb.gigasciencejournal.com:9170](http://gigadb.gigasciencejournal.com:9170/)

>**Note**:
>The first time, it will take longer to start the services as the 
**application** container needs to be built first.

To list the containers making up the GigaDB website:
```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                      NAMES

```


## Configuration variables

The project can be configured using the following files:
 
Type of variables | Configuration file
------------ | -------------
Deployment | `.env`
Application | [docker-compose.yml](ops/deployment/docker-compose.yml)* 
Passwords, API keys and tokens | `.secrets`

*`docker-compose.yml` overrides `docker-compose.*.yml`


## Running database migrations

Some code changes are database schemas changes. To ensure you have the latest 
database schema, you will need to run Yii migration as below:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm  application ./protected/yiic migrate --interactive=0
```

## Testing

To run the tests:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm test
```

This will run all the tests and generate a test coverage report. An headless 
Selenium web browser (currently PhantomJS) will be automatically spun-off into 
its own container. If an acceptance test fails, it will leave a screenshot under
the `./tmp` directory.

To only run unit tests, use the command:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm test ./tests/unit_tests
```

## Troubleshooting

To access the services logs, use the command below:
```
$ docker-compose logs <service name>			# e.g: docker-compose logs web
```

You can get information on the images, services and the processes running in 
them with these commands:
```
$ docker-compose images
$ docker-compose ps
$ docker-compose top
```

To debug the configuration or the tests, you can drop into `bash` with both 
containers:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm config bash
```
or:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm test bash
```

Both containers have access to the application source files, the Yii framework 
and Nginx site configuration (so they can be used to debug the running web 
application too).

The **test** container has also the PostgreSQL admin tools installed (pg\_dump, 
pg\_restore, psql), so it's a good place for debugging database issues. For 
further investigation, check out 
[docker-compose.yml](ops/deployment/docker-compose.yml) to see how the services 
are assembled and what scripts they run.

>**Note:**
>Only the **test** and **application** containers have access to the 
**database** container.


## Life cycle

To regenerate the web application configuration files, *e.g* because a variable 
is added or changed on GitLab or ``.env``:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm config
```

To restart, start or stop any of the services:
```
$ docker-compose restart|start|stop <service name>	# e.g: docker-compose restart database
```

To rebuild the local containers (**application** and **test**), *e.g* because of 
changes made to the [Dockerfile](ops/packaging/Dockerfile) or because the base 
image has been upgraded (see below):
```
$ docker-compose build <service name>				# e.g: docker-compose build application
```

To tear down all the services (the project data at location pointed at by 
DATA\_SAVE\_PATH *deployment variable* are unaffected):
```
$ docker-compose down
```

To upgrade the images used by the services (including base images for local 
containers) to the latest version of a fixed tag, without restarting the 
services:
```
$ docker-compose pull
```

>**Note**:
>To upgrade the core software to major revision, first change the version 
*deployment variables* in ``.env``.

## Generating the documentation

To update the browsable API Docs (PHPDoc), run the command below and then commit 
the changes:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm test ./docs/make_phpdoc
```
